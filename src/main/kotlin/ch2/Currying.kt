Exercise 2.3 / page 29
Letâ€™s look at another example, currying, which converts a function f of two arguments into a function with one argument
that partially applies f.
(Currying is named after the mathematician Haskell Curry, who discovered the principle.

Implement uncurry, which reverses the transformation of curry.
Note that since -> associates to the right, (A)->((B)->C) can be written as (A)->(B)->C.
